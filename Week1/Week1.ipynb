        "1. **NumPy** : The computing module. It eases various common algebraic operations such as matrix/vector multiplication, inverse, powers, calculating mean, variance, etc. \n",
        "2. **Scipy** : This as the name suggests is the scientific module. It eases operations such as calculating derivatives of functions, scaling and normalization. \n",
        "3. **MatPlotLib** : The plotting module. This helps us to plot various types of plots, histograms, line charts and many more. "
